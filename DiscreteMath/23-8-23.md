Discrete mathematics Propositional Logic

K(x): x is a man, L(x): x is a mortal, M(x): x is an integer, N(x): either negative or positive

for all x, K(x) -> L(x)  all men are mortal

for all x, M(x) -> N(x) any integers are either negative or positive


eg 55:

i. all integers are greater than 8'
ii. For all realnumbers x, if x > 3 then x^2 > 9
